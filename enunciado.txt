#### Portfolio Work - Individual
-> Create a website from your portfolio with VSCode in HTML and CSS. I won't charge a minimum number of Links, as each project can have its own characteristics and creativity. The Portfolio must contain information about your career, best works, images and/or videos and description of the works.
-> You should open a public repository on GitHub called Portfolio (for example) and put all the source code there. In TEAMS, you should just point to this GitHub repository link.
-> Delivery Date: 25/11
-> Delivery Rule: The delivery of the work will be made @ TEAMS in the Assignments section. You should just point to your GitHub project link.
